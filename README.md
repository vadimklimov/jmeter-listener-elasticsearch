# Elasticsearch listener for Apache JMeter
The listener plugin for Apache JMeter that enables delivery of samples' result data to Elasticsearch server using Elasticsearch API.

Usage of the plugin is described in SAP Community blog https://blogs.sap.com/2016/04/06/load-testing-with-jmeter-test-results-visualization-using-kibana-dashboards/.


## Prerequisites
* Java runtime 1.8 or higher.


## Dependencies
* Elasticsearch Java REST client library

Documentation: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/index.html

Dependency declaration for Maven POM:

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
	&lt;groupId&gt;org.elasticsearch.client&lt;/groupId&gt;
	&lt;artifactId&gt;rest&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	&lt;version&gt;RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>
* Several libraries (such as HTTP client that is used by Elasticsearch Java REST client, JSON processor, logging framework) that are already a part of JMeter distribution (the statement is based on content of distribution of JMeter version 3.2).


## Installation
* Copy dependency libraries to the directory **/&lt;JMeter home&gt;/lib/**.
* Copy plugin library to the directory **/&lt;JMeter home&gt;/lib/ext/**.

|proxy.domain|Domain name for authentication of requests sent over proxy server. Applicable to NTLM authentication method||
|experimental.connection.trustAllSslCertificates|Enable trust all SSL certificates when establishing connection to Elasticsearch server. Possible values: true / false. Not recommended for production usage due to security considerations|false|


## Additional notes
The listener plugin has been tested with JMeter version 3.3 running on JRE versions 1.8 and 1.9 in conjunction with Elasticsearch server version 5.6.3.

In recent versions of JMeter API, several methods related to sample result processing, have been deprecated and newer replacing methods were introduced. The current version of the listener plugin makes use of the latter methods.

Recent versions of JMeter API deprecate usage of Jorphan Logging Manager, which is superseded with Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J). The current version of the listener plugin makes use of SLF4J for logging.
